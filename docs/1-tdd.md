# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

###_How to stay in control while programming - even if the code complexity exceeds your mental capacity._

1. Developers write automated tests while they are developing code
2. _Most_ tests come into place before the application code they check
3. Design is taking place continuously and in small steps

### Why TDD Might Be a Good Idea

- Tests ensure that the existing functionality does not break
- Continuous Design and _Refactoring_ enhance the life span of software
- Adding tests in retrospective is much harder
- Small steps ensure continuous progress and regular feedback
