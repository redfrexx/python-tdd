## Session Inbox

###_How to structure a programming session without forgetting some details._

1. Collect all features / ideas / tests that are necessary 
   to resolve your next programming task
2. Choose one item from the list and solve it using Test-Code-Refactor
3. Maintain inbox:
   - Add new ideas
   - Remove out-of-scope ideas
   - Add additional tasks that are necessary (e.g. __refactorings__)
4. If inbox has open items -> Go to 2.
5. If inbox is empty, revisit and review current code and tests
